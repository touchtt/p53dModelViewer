<p>Persistence of vision is an optical illusion where the human eye perceives the continued presence of an image after it has disappeared from view. A common example of this is within stop motion animation where we see a moving image, when in reality it is a series of still images being displayed rapidly in succession. In turn, our eyes and brain interpret them as a single image.</p>
