<p>Persistence of vision traditionally refers to the optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object persists even after it has left the field of vision. The illusion has also been described as â€œretinal persistenceâ€, â€œpersistence of impressionsâ€, simply â€œpersistenceâ€ and other variations. A very commonly given example of the phenomenon is the apparent fiery trail of a glowing coal or burning stick while it is whirled around in the dark.</p>
