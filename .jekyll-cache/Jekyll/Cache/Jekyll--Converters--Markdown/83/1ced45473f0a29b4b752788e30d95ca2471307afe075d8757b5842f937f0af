<p>Persistence of vision traditionally refers to the optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object persists even after it has . The illusion has also been described as â€œretinal persistenceâ€,[2] â€œpersistence of impressionsâ€, simply â€œpersistenceâ€ and other variations. A very commonly given example of the phenomenon is the apparent fiery trail of a glowing coal or burning stick while it is whirled around in the dark.</p>
